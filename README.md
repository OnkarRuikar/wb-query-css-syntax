# query-css-syntax

This package makes it easier to get CSS syntax definitions from the [@webref/css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/css) package.

The syntax of each CSS property (and other CSS items) is precisely defined using a [value definition syntax](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#value-defs). The [@webref/css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/css) package includes this information on a per-spec basis. This package uses @webref/css to generate complete syntax for a single CSS item, including all the subtypes that participate in the definition of the item.

## Usage

```js
import { getPropertySyntax } from "query-css-syntax";

const typesToSkip = ["<color>"];
const syntax = getPropertySyntax("border-top", typesToSkip);

console.log(syntax);

/*
{
  syntax: '<line-width> || <line-style> || <color>',
  constituents: {
    'line-width': '<length [0,âˆž]> | thin | medium | thick',
    'line-style': 'none | hidden | dotted | dashed | solid | double | groove | ridge | inset | outset'
  }
}
*/
```

## API

This package exports one function, `getPropertySyntax()`. This function takes two arguments:

- `propertyName`: the name of a CSS property
- `typesToOmit`: an array listing types for which you don't want the function to find subtypes. For example, the complete definition of `<color>` is very long, so it's usually better to link to a separate definition of it than to include the definition here.

The function returns an object with two properties:

- `syntax`: a string containing the syntax for the property
- `constituents`: an object with one member for each subtype that participates in the property's syntax definition. The key is the name of the subtype, and the value is the syntax for the subtype.

## Dependencies

This package uses [@webref/css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/css) to retrieve syntaxes, and [css-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-tree) to find types in syntax definitions.
